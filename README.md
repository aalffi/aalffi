### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Fachrudin Nur Alfiansyah, a sixth-semester student at Gunadarma University. 
Currently, I am participating in an independent study activity as part of the Merdeka Campus program. 
The learning activity I have chosen is the Bangkit Academy 2024, presented by Google, GoTo, and Traveloka, following the Cloud Computing learning path.
